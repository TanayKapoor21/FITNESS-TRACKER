# FITNESS-TRACKER

This code defines a FitnessTracker class that allows users to log workouts, calculates the distance between workout locations using the Google Maps API, and displays the total duration of workouts and distance covered. It's customizable for different user types, with special messages for disabled users. The log_workout method records the activity and duration of a workout, and the display_progress method shows the total duration and distance covered.
